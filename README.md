Monitor a process and trigger a notification.

Never sit and wait for some long-running process to finish. Noti can alert you
when it's done. You can receive messages on your computer or phone.

## Installation

The `master` branch always contains the latest tagged release.

```shell
# Install the latest version on macOS.
brew install noti
```

If you don't want to build from source or install anything extra, just download
the latest binary.

```shell
# macOS
curl -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/variadico/noti/releases/latest | awk '/browser_download_url/ { print $2 }' | grep 'darwin-amd64' | sed 's/"//g') | tar -xz

# Linux
curl -L $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/variadico/noti/releases/latest | awk '/browser_download_url/ { print $2 }' | grep 'linux-amd64' | sed 's/"//g') | tar -xz
```

Or download with your browser from the [latest release] page.

### From source

If you want to build from source, then build like this.

```shell
make build
# or
make install
```

This project uses modules with vendoring. The Makefile sets `-mod=vendor`
automatically. Otherwise, you'll need to pass a flag or export a var if you
don't use the Makefile.

```shell
go build -mod=vendor github.com/variadico/noti/cmd/noti
# or
export GOFLAGS="-mod=vendor"
export GO111MODULE="on"
go build github.com/variadico/noti/cmd/noti
```

Also, `go get` doesn't really work anymore starting in Go 1.12.

If you have comments about these changes, please the leave the Go team an

## Examples

Just put `noti` at the beginning or end of your regular commands. For more
details, checkout the [docs].

Display a notification when `tar` finishes compressing files.

```
noti tar -cjf music.tar.bz2 Music/
```

Add `noti` after a command, in case you forgot at the beginning.

```
clang foo.c -Wall -lm -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -o bizz; noti
```

If you already started a command, but forgot to use `noti`, then you can do
this to get notified when that process' PID disappears.

```
noti --pwatch 1234
```

You can also press `ctrl+z` after you started a process. This will temporarily
suspend the process, but you can resume it with `noti`.

```
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=2000
^Z
zsh: suspended  dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=2000
$ fg; noti
[1]  + continued  dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=2000
2000+0 records in
2000+0 records out
2097152000 bytes (2.1 GB, 2.0 GiB) copied, 12 s, 175 MB/s
```

Additionally, `noti` can send a message piped from stdin with `-`.

```
$ make test 2>&1 | tail --lines 5 | noti -t "Test Results" -m -
```
