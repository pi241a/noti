Trigger notifications when a process completes.

Never sit and wait for some long-running process to finish! `noti` will alert
you when it's done—on your computer or smartphone—so you can stop worrying about
constantly checking the terminal.

### Environment

You can further configure `noti` by setting the following environment variables.
Some are required for specific notifications. For example, `NOTI_PUSHBULLET_TOK`
**must** be set to use Pushbullet notifications. Others can be used to
optionally change the default behavior, like setting `NOTI_VOICE` to change the
voice used in speech notifications.

```
NOTI_DEFAULT
    Notification types noti should trigger in a space-delimited list. For
    example, set NOTI_DEFAULT="banner speech pushbullet slack" to enable
    all available notifications to fire sequentially.
NOTI_HIPCHAT_TOK
    HipChat access token. Log into your HipChat account and retrieve a token
    from the Room Notification Tokens page.
NOTI_HIPCHAT_DEST
    HipChat message destination. Can be either a Room name or ID.

```

#### OS X only

```

    Banner success sound. Default is Ping. Possible options are Basso, Blow,
    Bottle, Frog, Funk, Glass, Hero, Morse, Ping, Pop, Purr, Sosumi,
    Submarine, Tink. See /System/Library/Sounds for available sounds.

    Blow, Bottle, Frog, Funk, Glass, Hero, Morse, Ping, Pop, Purr, Sosumi,
    Submarine, Tink. See /System/Library/Sounds for available sounds.
```

## Examples

Display a notification when `tar` finishes compressing files.

```
noti tar -cjf music.tar.bz2 Music/
```

You can also add `noti` after a command, in case you forgot at the beginning.

```
clang foo.c -Wall -lm -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -o bizz; noti
```

If you already started a command, but forgot to use `noti`, then you can do this
to get notified when that process' PID disappears.

```
noti -pwatch $(pgrep docker-machine)
```

An easier alternative is to press `ctrl+z` after you started a process. This
will put it in the background. Then, you can bring it back and append `noti`.

```
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=2000
^Z
zsh: suspended  dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=2000
$ fg; noti
[1]  + continued  dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=2000
2000+0 records in
2000+0 records out
2097152000 bytes (2.1 GB, 2.0 GiB) copied, 12 s, 175 MB/s
